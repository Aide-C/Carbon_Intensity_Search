# Local Carbon Intensity Search

My semester project for my spring 2024 Introduction to Green Computing course at TXST. The website provides the carbon intensity and power breakdown of the user's input coordinates(longitude and latitude).

## Description 

Carbon emissions are a primary contributor to global warming and climate change, with severe consequences for ecosystems and our well-being. Understanding the sources and levels of emissions at a local level is essential for implementing effective strategies and adapting to the impacts of climate change. This website helps people find out the estimated carbon intensity of their latitude and longitude coordinates based on the open-sourced data API from the Electricity Maps software company. By accurately assessing carbon emissions in specific locations, policymakers, businesses, and communities can make informed decisions to reduce their carbon footprint, improve air quality, and enhance environmental sustainability.
